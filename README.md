# Dice-Realms
This project was a major milestone in my university journey, where I developed a game from scratch using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It showcases my ability to write clean, efficient code and implement a well-structured graphical user interface (GUI).

I had the privilege of working on this project while attending the German International University in Berlin as part of a semester exchange program, awarded through the prestigious DAAD scholarship for my high academic performance at the German University in Cairo.

This experience not only strengthened my programming skills but also enriched my academic and cultural perspective. I'm proud of the outcome and excited to continue building innovative projects! ðŸš€
